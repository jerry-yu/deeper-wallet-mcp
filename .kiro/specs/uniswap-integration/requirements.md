# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating Uniswap functionality into the deeperWallet project. The feature will add support for Uniswap V2 and V3 swap operations and liquidity pool queries, enabling users to perform decentralized exchange operations directly through the wallet's MCP interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to swap tokens on Uniswap, so that I can exchange one ERC20 token for another without leaving the wallet interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a token swap THEN the system SHALL calculate the optimal swap route using Uniswap V2/V3 protocols
2. WHEN a user provides valid token addresses and amounts THEN the system SHALL execute the swap transaction on the Ethereum network
3. WHEN a swap is executed THEN the system SHALL return the transaction hash and swap details
4. IF insufficient liquidity exists THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a user requests swap preview THEN the system SHALL return estimated output amounts and price impact

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to query Uniswap pool information, so that I can view liquidity, prices, and trading data for token pairs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user queries a token pair THEN the system SHALL return current pool reserves and liquidity
2. WHEN a user requests pool information THEN the system SHALL return current token prices and 24h volume data
3. WHEN a user queries pool data THEN the system SHALL support both V2 and V3 pool formats
4. IF a pool does not exist THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate message indicating no pool found
5. WHEN pool data is requested THEN the system SHALL return fee tier information for V3 pools

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to get token price quotes from Uniswap, so that I can make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a price quote THEN the system SHALL return the current exchange rate between two tokens
2. WHEN calculating quotes THEN the system SHALL consider slippage and price impact
3. WHEN providing quotes THEN the system SHALL indicate which Uniswap version (V2/V3) offers the best rate
4. IF multiple pools exist for a pair THEN the system SHALL return the most liquid pool's pricing
5. WHEN quotes are requested THEN the system SHALL include minimum output amounts with slippage protection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want the Uniswap integration to work seamlessly with my existing wallet addresses, so that I can use my current accounts for trading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing swaps THEN the system SHALL use the wallet's existing Ethereum addresses
2. WHEN executing transactions THEN the system SHALL properly handle gas estimation and pricing
3. WHEN swaps are initiated THEN the system SHALL require proper token approvals for ERC20 transfers
4. IF token approval is needed THEN the system SHALL execute approval transactions before swaps
5. WHEN transactions are submitted THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing transaction signing mechanism

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Uniswap functionality to follow the existing code patterns, so that it integrates cleanly with the current architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Uniswap features THEN the system SHALL follow the existing module structure in deeperWallet directory
2. WHEN adding new functions THEN the system SHALL use the same error handling patterns as existing modules
3. WHEN creating the uniswap module THEN the system SHALL export functions that can be imported by the main index.js
4. IF external APIs are needed THEN the system SHALL use the existing axios and caching patterns
5. WHEN implementing swap logic THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing Ethereum transaction flow
