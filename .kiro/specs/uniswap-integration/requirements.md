# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Uniswap integration to the deeper wallet system, enabling users to perform decentralized token swaps, get swap quotes, retrieve pool information, and find optimal trading routes using Uniswap's official SDK libraries. The integration will provide a comprehensive interface for interacting with Uniswap V3 and V4 protocols.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to swap tokens through Uniswap, so that I can exchange one cryptocurrency for another at market rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls swapTokens with valid token addresses and amounts THEN the system SHALL execute the swap transaction using Uniswap SDK
2. WHEN a swap is initiated THEN the system SHALL validate token addresses and amounts before execution
3. WHEN a swap fails THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message
4. WHEN a swap succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the transaction hash and swap details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to get swap quotes before executing trades, so that I can understand the expected output and fees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a swap quote with token pair and amount THEN the system SHALL return expected output amount
2. WHEN getting a quote THEN the system SHALL include price impact information
3. WHEN getting a quote THEN the system SHALL include estimated gas fees
4. WHEN invalid tokens are provided THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to view pool information, so that I can understand liquidity and trading conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests pool info for a token pair THEN the system SHALL return liquidity amounts
2. WHEN getting pool info THEN the system SHALL return current price and fee tier
3. WHEN getting pool info THEN the system SHALL return volume statistics if available
4. WHEN a pool doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return a clear message indicating no pool found

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to see available pools, so that I can choose from different trading options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests pool list THEN the system SHALL return active pools with basic information
2. WHEN listing pools THEN the system SHALL include token pairs and fee tiers
3. WHEN listing pools THEN the system SHALL include TVL (Total Value Locked) information
4. WHEN no pools are available THEN the system SHALL return an empty list with appropriate message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to find the best trading route, so that I can get optimal prices for my swaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests best route for a token pair THEN the system SHALL analyze multiple paths
2. WHEN finding routes THEN the system SHALL consider price impact and fees
3. WHEN multiple routes exist THEN the system SHALL return the most cost-effective option
4. WHEN no route exists THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating no trading path available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use official Uniswap SDK libraries, so that the integration is reliable and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing swap functionality THEN the system SHALL use @uniswap/sdk-core
2. WHEN implementing routing THEN the system SHALL use @uniswap/universal-router-sdk
3. WHEN working with V3 pools THEN the system SHALL use @uniswap/v3-sdk
4. WHEN working with V4 pools THEN the system SHALL use @uniswap/v4-sdk

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing with real tokens, so that I can verify the integration works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the implementation THEN the system SHALL test with WETH token (0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2)
2. WHEN testing the implementation THEN the system SHALL test with USDT token (0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7)
3. WHEN running tests THEN all functions SHALL be called sequentially in main2 function
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL verify that returned results are correct and properly formatted
