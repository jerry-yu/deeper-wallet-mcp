# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Uniswap integration capabilities to the deeperWallet system, enabling users to perform token swaps and query liquidity pool information directly through the wallet interface. The integration will utilize official Uniswap SDK libraries to ensure compatibility and reliability, while maintaining integration with the existing deeperWallet signing infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to swap tokens on Uniswap, so that I can exchange one cryptocurrency for another without leaving the wallet interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a token swap THEN the system SHALL calculate the optimal swap route using Uniswap V3/V4 protocols
2. WHEN a swap transaction is prepared THEN the system SHALL use the DEEPER_WALLET_BIN_PATH sign-tx operation for transaction signing
3. WHEN a swap is executed THEN the system SHALL return the transaction hash and status to the user
4. IF insufficient balance exists THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
5. WHEN slippage tolerance is specified THEN the system SHALL respect the user's slippage settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to query Uniswap pool information, so that I can make informed decisions about trading and liquidity provision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user queries a trading pair THEN the system SHALL return current pool liquidity, price, and fee information
2. WHEN pool data is requested THEN the system SHALL support both V3 and V4 pool queries
3. WHEN multiple pools exist for a pair THEN the system SHALL return information for all available fee tiers
4. IF a pool does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a clear "pool not found" message
5. WHEN pool statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL include 24h volume and price change data when available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Uniswap module to integrate seamlessly with the existing deeperWallet architecture, so that it maintains consistency with other wallet functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the uniswap module is loaded THEN it SHALL follow the same directory structure as other wallet modules
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use the existing logging infrastructure from deeperWallet
3. WHEN database operations are needed THEN the system SHALL utilize the existing db.js utilities
4. WHEN network requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle connection errors gracefully
5. WHEN the module is imported THEN it SHALL export functions compatible with the main wallet interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to receive accurate price quotes before executing swaps, so that I can understand the expected outcome of my transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a swap quote THEN the system SHALL return the expected output amount and price impact
2. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL provide updated quotes within a reasonable time window
3. WHEN gas fees are calculated THEN the system SHALL include estimated gas costs in the quote
4. IF price impact exceeds a threshold THEN the system SHALL warn the user about high price impact
5. WHEN multiple routes are available THEN the system SHALL select the most efficient route by default

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want the system to handle different token types and standards, so that I can swap various cryptocurrencies supported by Uniswap.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN swapping ERC-20 tokens THEN the system SHALL handle token approvals automatically
2. WHEN dealing with ETH THEN the system SHALL properly handle WETH wrapping/unwrapping as needed
3. WHEN token decimals vary THEN the system SHALL correctly calculate amounts using proper decimal precision
4. IF a token is not supported THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
5. WHEN token metadata is needed THEN the system SHALL fetch and cache token information efficiently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Uniswap integration functions to work correctly when called from the main application, so that I can reliably execute swaps and retrieve pool information in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN swapTokens function is called THEN the system SHALL execute token swaps successfully using official Uniswap SDK libraries
2. WHEN getSwapQuote function is called THEN the system SHALL return accurate price quotes and route information using official Uniswap SDK 
3. WHEN getPoolInfo function is called THEN the system SHALL retrieve current pool data including liquidity and pricing using official Uniswap SDK 
4. WHEN getPoolList function is called THEN the system SHALL return available pools for specified token pairs using official Uniswap SDK 
5. WHEN getBestRoute function is called THEN the system SHALL calculate and return the most efficient swap route using official Uniswap SDK 
6. IF network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages indicating network failures
7. WHEN functions are tested in main2 function THEN all operations SHALL complete successfully and return expected results
